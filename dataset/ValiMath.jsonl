Some subparts lack sufficient detail or assumptions (e.g., the impact of an annual interest rate applied monthly for the TV payment scenario).\n2. In the pipe packing optimization problem, the problem does not specify certain constraints such as the orientation of the pipes or whether overlapping is allowed.

Includes elementary arithmetic for discount calculation, followed by loan payment estimation. Assumptions for interest calculation should be clarified to avoid ambiguity.\n- **Pipe Packing Problem**: Reasonable premise but solvability depends on clarifying certain spatial constraints on the pipe packing arrangement. Requires geometry of pipe placement within a grid. \n- **Factory Production Rate Problem**: Reasonable overall, but lacks completion in terms of sub-problem phrasing for sub-question 6, minor corrections can finalize the problem.\n\nIn conclusion, the problem set is solvable with reasonable mathematical foundations.

The smaller plot is to be surrounded by a circular path with the shorter side of the smaller plot as the diameter of the circle. If the circular path intersects the 32-meter side at a point 8 meters from the corner, and the longer side of the smaller plot is 16 meters, find the length of the segment between the intersection point and the center of the circle. 1. Given a rectangular plot of land with dimensions 24 meters by 32 meters, we need to find the length of the segment between the intersection point and the center of the circle. The smaller rectangular plot has one side along the 24-meter side and the other side parallel to the 32-meter side, and the longer side of the smaller plot is 16 meters. The circular path has the shorter side of the smaller plot as its diameter and intersects the 32-meter side at a point 8 meters from the corner.\n2. Let's denote the smaller rectangular plot by \\(ABCD\\) with \\(AB = 16\\) meters and \\(BC = 24\\) meters. The circle has \\(AB\\) as its diameter, so the center of the circle, \\(O\\), is the midpoint of \\(AB\\).

The length of the segment between the intersection point \\((16, 12)\\) and the center of the circle \\((8, 12)\\) is the horizontal distance between these two points, which is \\(16 - 8 = 8\\) meters.\n5.

{"question_no":1112,"question":" No need for a question prompt.\n\n        Among 40 one-yuan coins, there are 10 fifty-cent coins mixed in. If three coins are randomly selected and it is known that at least one of them is a fifty-cent coin, then the probability that all three are fifty-cent coins is ( ).\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that all three selected coins are fifty-cent coins given that at least one of the selected coins is a fifty-cent coin.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of ways to select 3 coins out of 40. This is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{40}{3} = \\frac{40!}{3! \\cdot 37!} = \\frac{40 \\times 39 \\times 38}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 9880\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of ways to select 3 coins such that at least one of them is a fifty-cent coin. To do this, we use the complementary probability approach, which is the probability of the complement event (none of the selected coins are fifty-cent coins).\n\nThe number of ways to select 3 coins out of the 30 one-yuan coins is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{30}{3} = \\frac{30!}{3! \\times 27!} = \\frac{30 \\times 29 \\times 28}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 4060\n\\]\n\nSo, the number of ways to select 3 coins such that at least one is a fifty-cent coin is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{40}{3} - \\binom{30}{3} = 9880 - 4060 = 5820\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways to select 3 fifty-cent coins out of the 10 fifty-cent coins:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{10}{3} = \\frac{10!}{3! \\times 7!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 120\n\\]\n\nThe probability that all three selected coins","question_format":false,"level_0_check":null,"min_Pi_check":null,"contradiction_check":null,"condition_complete_check":null,"gt":false,"primary_category":"5.

It is more or less a straightforward generalization of [url=http:\/\/www.kalva.demon.co.uk\/imo\/isoln\/isoln931.html]IMO 1993 problem 1[\/url].\r\n\r\nThe idea behind is an extension of Eisenstein's criterion for irreducible polynomials:\r\n\r\n[color=blue][b]Lemma 1.[\/b] Let p be a prime number. If a polynomial $ A\\left(x\\right) \\equal{} a_nx^n \\plus{} a_{n \\minus{} 1}x^{n \\minus{} 1} \\plus{} ... \\plus{} a_1x \\plus{} a_0$ with integer coefficients $ a_n$, $ a_{n \\minus{} 1}$, ..., $ a_1$, $ a_0$ is reducible in $ \\mathbb{Z}\\left[x\\right]$, and the prime p divides the coefficients $ a_0$, $ a_1$, ..., $ a_{n \\minus{} 2}$, but does not divide $ a_n$, and $ p^2$ does not divide $ a_0$, then p does not divide $ a_{n \\minus{} 1}$, and the polynomial A(x) must have a rational root.[\/color]\r\n\r\n[i]Proof of Lemma 1.[\/i] Since the polynomial A(x) is reducible in $ \\mathbb{Z}\\left[x\\right]$, we can write it in the form A(x) = B(x) C(x), where $ B\\left(x\\right) \\equal{} b_ux^u \\plus{} ... \\plus{} b_1x \\plus{} b_0$ and $ C\\left(x\\right) \\equal{} c_vx^v \\plus{} ... \\plus{} c_1x \\plus{} c_0$ are non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients $ b_u$, ..., $ b_1$, $ b_0$, $ c_v$, ..., $ c_1$, $ c_0$. Then, for any i, we have $ a_i \\equal{} \\sum_{k \\equal{} 0}^i b_kc_{i \\minus{} k}$ (this follows from multiplying out the equation A(x) = B(x) C(x)). Particularly, $ a_0 \\equal{} b_0c_0$. But since the integer $ a_0$ is divisible by the prime p, but not by $ p^2$, this yields that one of the integers $ b_0$ and $ c_0$ is divisible by p, and the other one is not. WLOG assume that $ b_0$ is divisible by p, and $ c_0$ is not.\r\n\r\nNot all coefficients $ b_u$, ..., $ b_1$, $ b_0$ of the polynomial B(x) can be divisible by p (else, $ a_n \\equal{} \\sum_{k \\equal{} 0}^n b_kc_{n \\minus{} k}$ would also be divisible by p, what is excluded). Let $ \\lambda$ be the least nonnegative integer such that the coefficient $ b_{\\lambda}$ is [i]not[\/i] divisible by p. Then, all the integers $ b_k$ with $ k < \\lambda$ are divisible by p. Hence, in the sum $ a_{\\lambda} \\equal{} \\sum_{k \\equal{} 0}^{\\lambda} b_kc_{\\lambda \\minus{} k}$, all the summands $ b_kc_{\\lambda \\minus{} k}$ with $ k < \\lambda$ are divisible by p, but the summand $ b_{\\lambda}c_0$ (this is the summand for $ k \\equal{} \\lambda$) is not (since $ b_{\\lambda}$ is not divisible by p, and neither is $ c_0$). Hence, the whole sum $ a_{\\lambda}$ is not divisible by p. But we know that the coefficients $ a_0$, $ a_1$, ..., $ a_{n \\minus{} 2}$ are all divisible by p; hence, $ a_{\\lambda}$ must be one of the coefficients $ a_{n \\minus{} 1}$ and $ a_n$. Thus, either $ \\lambda \\equal{} n \\minus{} 1$ or $ \\lambda \\equal{} n$.\r\n\r\nIf $ \\lambda \\equal{} n$, then it follows, since the integer $ b_{\\lambda}$ is defined, that the polynomial B(x) has a coefficient $ b_n$. In other words, the polynomial B(x) has degree n. Since the polynomial A(x) has degree n, too, it follows from A(x) = B(x) C(x) that the polynomial C(x) is a constant. This is a contradiction.\r\n\r\nThus, we must have $ \\lambda \\equal{} n \\minus{} 1$. Hence, the integer $ a_{n \\minus{} 1} \\equal{} a_{\\lambda}$ is not divisible by p. Also, since the integer $ b_{\\lambda}$ is defined, it follows that the polynomial B(x) has a coefficient $ b_{n \\minus{} 1}$. In other words, the polynomial B(x) has degree $ \\geq n \\minus{} 1$. Since the polynomial A(x) has degree n and A(x) = B(x) C(x), this yields that the polynomial C(x) has degree $ \\leq 1$. The degree cannot be 0, since the polynomial C(x) is not constant; thus, the degree is 1. Hence, the polynomial A(x) has a linear factor, i. e. it has a rational root. Lemma 1 is proven.\r\n\r\nNow let us solve the problem: The number $ pq$ is squarefree (since $ p$ is prime and $ q$ is squarefree, and since $ p\\nmid q$).\r\n\r\nApplying Lemma 1 to the polynomial $ x^n \\plus{} ax^{n \\minus{} 1} \\plus{} pq$, using the prime p, we see that, if this polynomial can be factored into two non-constant integral polynomials, then it must have a rational root. Since it is a monic polynomial with integer coefficients, it thus must have an integer root. If we denote this root by $ r$, then $ r^n \\plus{} ar^{n \\minus{} 1} \\plus{} pq \\equal{} 0$, so that $ pq \\equal{} \\minus{} r^n \\minus{} ar^{n \\minus{} 1} \\equal{} \\minus{} \\left(r \\plus{} a\\right) r^{n \\minus{} 1}$ is divisible by $ r^2$ (since $ n\\geq 3$ yields $ n \\minus{} 1\\geq 2$, so that $ r^{n \\minus{} 1}$ is divisible by $ r^2$), so that $ r \\equal{} 1$ or $ r \\equal{} \\minus{} 1$ (since $ pq$ is squarefree), so that one of the numbers $ 1$ and $ \\minus{} 1$ must be a root of the polynomial $ x^n \\plus{} ax^{n \\minus{} 1} \\plus{} pq$.\r\n\r\nHence, we see that, if the polynomial $ x^n \\plus{} ax^{n \\minus{} 1} \\plus{} pq$ can be factored into two non-constant integral polynomials, then one of the numbers $ 1$ and $ \\minus{} 1$ must be a root of this polynomial. Conversely, if one of the numbers $ 1$ and $ \\minus{} 1$ is a root of this polynomial, then it has an integer root and thus can be factored into two non-constant integral polynomials. Hence, in order to solve the problem, it remains to find all integers a such that one of the numbers $ 1$ and $ \\minus{} 1$ is a root of the polynomial $ x^n \\plus{} ax^{n \\minus{} 1} \\plus{} pq$. But in fact, $ 1$ is a root of the polynomial $ x^n \\plus{} ax^{n \\minus{} 1} \\plus{} pq$ if and only if $ 1^n \\plus{} a\\cdot 1^{n \\minus{} 1} \\plus{} pq \\equal{} 0$, what is equivalent to $ 1 \\plus{} a \\plus{} pq \\equal{} 0$, i. e. to $ a \\equal{} \\minus{} 1 \\minus{} pq$, and $ \\minus{} 1$ is a root of the polynomial $ x^n \\plus{} ax^{n \\minus{} 1} \\plus{} pq$ if and only if $ \\left( \\minus{} 1\\right)^n \\plus{} a\\cdot\\left( \\minus{} 1\\right)^{n \\minus{} 1} \\plus{} pq \\equal{} 0$, what is equivalent to $ a \\equal{} 1 \\plus{} \\left( \\minus{} 1\\right)^n pq$. So, the two required values of $ a$ are $ a \\equal{} \\minus{} 1 \\minus{} pq$ and $ a \\equal{} 1 \\plus{} \\left( \\minus{} 1\\right)^n pq$.\r\n\r\nThe problem is thus solved.\r\n\r\n[hide=\"Old version of the solution, not generalizing the problem\"]\n\n[i]Old version of the solution (of the original problem, not of the generalization).[\/i]\n\nApplying Lemma 1 to the polynomial $ x^n \\plus{} ax^{n \\minus{} 1} \\plus{} pq$, using the prime p, we see that, if this polynomial can be factored into two non-constant integral polynomials, then it must have a rational root. Since it is a monic polynomial with integer coefficients, it thus must have an integer root, and by a well-known theorem, this integer root then must be a divisor of pq. This means that the root is one of the numbers pq, p, q, 1, -pq, -p, -q, -1. Actually, none of the numbers pq, p, q, -pq, -p, -q can be a root of the polynomial $ x^n \\plus{} ax^{n \\minus{} 1} \\plus{} pq$ (in fact, every of these numbers is divisible by p or by q, and if an integer root r of the polynomial $ x^n \\plus{} ax^{n \\minus{} 1} \\plus{} pq$ would be divisible by p, then $ r^n \\plus{} ar^{n \\minus{} 1}$ would be divisible by $ p^{n \\minus{} 1}$, while $ pq$ wouldn't be because of $ n\\geq 3$, so $ r^n \\plus{} ar^{n \\minus{} 1} \\plus{} pq$ couldn't be 0, what yields a contradiction, and similarly we obtain a contradiction if an integer root would be divisible by q). Hence, only 1 and -1 remain as possible candidates for integer roots of the polynomial $ x^n \\plus{} ax^{n \\minus{} 1} \\plus{} pq$.\n\nHence, we see that, if the polynomial $ x^n \\plus{} ax^{n \\minus{} 1} \\plus{} pq$ can be factored into two non-constant integral polynomials, then one of the numbers 1 and -1 must be a root of this polynomial. Conversely, if one of the numbers 1 and -1 is a root of this polynomial, then it has an integer root and thus can be factored into two non-constant integral polynomials. Hence, in order to solve the problem, it remains to find all integers a such that one of the numbers 1 and -1 is a root of the polynomial $ x^n \\plus{} ax^{n \\minus{} 1} \\plus{} pq$. But in fact, 1 is a root of the polynomial $ x^n \\plus{} ax^{n \\minus{} 1} \\plus{} pq$ if and only if $ 1^n \\plus{} a\\cdot 1^{n \\minus{} 1} \\plus{} pq \\equal{} 0$, what is equivalent to $ 1 \\plus{} a \\plus{} pq \\equal{} 0$, i. e. to a = - 1 - pq, and -1 is a root of the polynomial $ x^n \\plus{} ax^{n \\minus{} 1} \\plus{} pq$ if and only if $ \\left( \\minus{} 1\\right)^n \\plus{} a\\cdot\\left( \\minus{} 1\\right)^{n \\minus{} 1} \\plus{} pq \\equal{} 0$, what is equivalent to $ a \\equal{} 1 \\plus{} \\left( \\minus{} 1\\right)^n pq$.
